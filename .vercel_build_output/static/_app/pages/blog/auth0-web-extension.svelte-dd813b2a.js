      making the barrier between them and the rest of the JS running on webpages much stronger. Now one concern that I still felt lingering was that even though our access token is still only ever available in the background script, there is a lot of messaging back and forth
      with content scripts, and in fact it's a content script that runs the /authorize IFrame and receives the code and state from auth0. We already know that the /authorize IFrame will be created on a webpage which we control (specifically our redirect_uri), but it
      still would be nice to have an extra layer of assurance that no one is able to intercept our code and hijack our token. This problem actually almost solves itself as a result of the oauth flow that Auth0 uses which is called PKCE (read about it `),B=a("a"),za=s("here"),$e=a("sup"),Ra=s("[3]"),Ha=s(`).
      Basically, even in the very unlikely event that our code is intercepted, an attacker will still be unable to exchange this for an access token without including our code_verifier, which we created in our background script.
      The sha256 hash of this string is included in our /authorize url as our code_challenge, and must be included in our call to /oauth/token in order to get our access token.`),Oa=c(),ce=a("h5"),Ua=s("IFrame within an IFrame"),Da=c(),F=a("p"),Ma=s("This is probably the strangest part of the entire flow.

Why can't we just have created the /authorize IFrame directly on the page instead of going through all this trouble?
      Well the answer has to do with redirect URLs. If we were to create our IFrame on whatever page the user is currently browsing (let's say Wikipedia), our request to Auth0 is going to show us trying to use https://wikipedia.org as our redirect_uri, which it will complain
      isn't in our list of allowed redirects. I believe that Auth0 also sets the X-Frame-Ancestors option to only allow embedding of the /authorize url on domains that are set as redirect URLs to prevent clickjacking attacks. We definitely don't want to add redirect URLs that we
      don't control as this would mean those pages could perform login requests on our behalf, and so our only choice is to somehow create this /authorize IFrame from one of our redirect URLs. So immediately my thought was, if Auth0 can create a hidden IFrame for their domain, what if we did the same for ours, 
      and this is where the idea for an IFrame within an IFrame comes from. This also gives the added benefit of allowing us to share the users login state with the extension automatically, e.g. if a user is signed in on https://joinpatchwork.com and we use that as our redirect_uri, this login state will immediately be shared with the extension, allowing users to sign in outside of the extension and have their session shared automatically.`),Va=c(),de=a("h5"),Ga=s("No external messaging"),Ja=c(),ue=a("p"),Qa=s(`This design consideration was something I wasn't actually sure was possible for quite some time until I remembered the "all_frames" option.

      option in the manifest, and also would make it more difficult for an attacker to craft a malicious message as without external messaging they would first need to somehow gain access to the content script execution context. The trickiest step in this process is after we have created the first IFrame
      with our redirect URI, as immediately the question is once we get our code parameter from /authorize, how do we get it back to the background script, and the answer to this is to use the "all_frames" option and have our content script injected into this newly created IFrame and immediately
      create a connection to the backend.

      These extensions might send a message to the background script asking for some piece of data (e.g. asking to check a paragraph for errors in the Grammarly example), after which the background script would call getTokenSilently, perform this handshake, use the token to query an API, and then return the results back to the content script in a message.

      making the barrier between them and the rest of the JS running on webpages much stronger. Now one concern that I still felt lingering was that even though our access token is still only ever available in the background script, there is a lot of messaging back and forth
      with content scripts, and in fact it's a content script that runs the /authorize IFrame and receives the code and state from auth0. We already know that the /authorize IFrame will be created on a webpage which we control (specifically our redirect_uri), but it
      still would be nice to have an extra layer of assurance that no one is able to intercept our code and hijack our token. This problem actually almost solves itself as a result of the oauth flow that Auth0 uses which is called PKCE (read about it `),B=o(z,"A",{href:!0});var Qo=n(B);za=i(Qo,"here"),$e=o(Qo,"SUP",{});var Vn=n($e);Ra=i(Vn,"[3]"),Vn.forEach(t),Qo.forEach(t),Ha=i(z,`).
      Basically, even in the very unlikely event that our code is intercepted, an attacker will still be unable to exchange this for an access token without including our code_verifier, which we created in our background script.
      The sha256 hash of this string is included in our /authorize url as our code_challenge, and must be included in our call to /oauth/token in order to get our access token.`),z.forEach(t),Oa=d(l),ce=o(l,"H5",{class:!0});var Gn=n(ce);Ua=i(Gn,"IFrame within an IFrame"),Gn.forEach(t),Da=d(l),F=o(l,"P",{class:!0});var dt=n(F);Ma=i(dt,"This is probably the strangest part of the entire flow.

Why can't we just have created the /authorize IFrame directly on the page instead of going through all this trouble?
      Well the answer has to do with redirect URLs. If we were to create our IFrame on whatever page the user is currently browsing (let's say Wikipedia), our request to Auth0 is going to show us trying to use https://wikipedia.org as our redirect_uri, which it will complain
      isn't in our list of allowed redirects. I believe that Auth0 also sets the X-Frame-Ancestors option to only allow embedding of the /authorize url on domains that are set as redirect URLs to prevent clickjacking attacks. We definitely don't want to add redirect URLs that we
      don't control as this would mean those pages could perform login requests on our behalf, and so our only choice is to somehow create this /authorize IFrame from one of our redirect URLs. So immediately my thought was, if Auth0 can create a hidden IFrame for their domain, what if we did the same for ours, 
      and this is where the idea for an IFrame within an IFrame comes from. This also gives the added benefit of allowing us to share the users login state with the extension automatically, e.g. if a user is signed in on https://joinpatchwork.com and we use that as our redirect_uri, this login state will immediately be shared with the extension, allowing users to sign in outside of the extension and have their session shared automatically.`),dt.forEach(t),Va=d(l),de=o(l,"H5",{class:!0});var Qn=n(de);Ga=i(Qn,"No external messaging"),Qn.forEach(t),Ja=d(l),ue=o(l,"P",{class:!0});var Kn=n(ue);Qa=i(Kn,`This design consideration was something I wasn't actually sure was possible for quite some time until I remembered the "all_frames" option. Basically, my goal was to avoid the use of onMessageExternal if possible, as this would remove the need to set the "externally_connectable"
      option in the manifest, and also would make it more difficult for an attacker to craft a malicious message as without external messaging they would first need to somehow gain access to the content script execution context. The trickiest step in this process is after we have created the first IFrame
      with our redirect URI, as immediately the question is once we get our code parameter from /authorize, how do we get it back to the background script, and the answer to this is to use the "all_frames" option and have our content script injected into this newly created IFrame and immediately
      create a connection to the backend.

While this is a limitation, I've found this still is able to work in most of the typical paradigms for extensions. Any extensions that add in some type of markup to a page and then need to perform authenticated requests when a user interacts with this markup (e.g. Grammarly, Honey, many others) are easily supported.
      These extensions might send a message to the background script asking for some piece of data (e.g. asking to check a paragraph for errors in the Grammarly example), after which the background script would call getTokenSilently, perform this handshake, use the token to query an API, and then return the results back to the content script in a message. This paradigm is by far the most common for web extensions, and now with some of the unfortunate changes in MV3, is
      one of the only paradigms that feels well supported.
